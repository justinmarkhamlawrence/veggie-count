Veggie-count

Purpose: To act as a simple app that allows the user to track
         the number of servings of vegetables consumed in a day,
         in accordance with seeking a healthier lifestyle.

Background: Many calorie tracking apps are complex, leading to user
            dissatisfaction. The intention for this app is to bypass the
            complexity typically associated with these apps but still
            encourage long term lifestyle changes by promoting better
            food choices.

Rationale: The goal for this app is for the user to consume 5 servings
           of vegetables a day. With increased intake of healthy food,
           the user will become more mindful about what they choose to
           snack on, leaving less room for junk food.

Usage: For each serving of vegetables in a given meal (or snack), the 
       user types in what type of vegetable they just ate and clicks
       the "+" button.
